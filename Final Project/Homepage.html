	<h3>1.) Atomic Heart</h3>
		<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA1NzBhODMtMmMxYS00NzE3LWE4YjUtYWFmNWRhNjhiNDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk2OTAzNTI@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg" alt="Atomic Heart">
		<p>An ambitious and imaginative atompunk-inspired game that follows in the footsteps of BioShock. While it has some flaws, such as an irritating protagonist and the use of tired tropes it tries to parody, it manages to leave a strong impression. This solo shooter with superpowered elements has the ability to captivate despite its shortcomings. Atomic Heart may not be flawless, but it punches above its weight has the potential to be truly remarkable."</p>
    <h3>2.) Pizza Tower</h3>

		<p>A remarkable 2D platformer that surpasses its inspirations and offers an exceptional experience. While it may appeal most to players who enjoy replaying levels to improve their score, there is plenty to enjoy for everyone. The game stands out with its unique art style, fantastic animations, satisfying platforming mechanics, imaginative level design, delightful sense of humor, and an outstanding soundtrack. It's a highly enjoyable and refreshing platformer that deserves recognition alongside the likes of Wario. Peppino Spaghetti is the new star of the genre.</p>
    <h3>3.) Honkai: Star Rail</h3>

		<p>A standout free-to-play game of the year, offering an impressive combination of storytelling and satisfying progression systems. It provides hours of content that can be enjoyed by newcomers to HoYo without the need to spend money on gacha items or having prior experience with Honkai Impact 3rd or Genshin Impact. The combat mechanics offer depth and strategy, catering to both dedicated and casual players. The worldbuilding extends beyond the main story, with side missions and interactive elements, enhancing the already captivating world. In my opinion, it surpasses even Genshin Impact, and I anticipate playing it for months to come.</p>
    <h3>4.) Hi-Fi Rush</h3></a>

		<p>A premier cartoon series that excels in animation quality, featuring endearing heroes and compelling villains, all complemented by good-natured humor. What sets it apart is its exceptional use of a dynamic rock soundtrack, meticulously synchronized with every aspect of the experience. This synchronization creates a uniquely satisfying momentum in combat, surpassing other stylish-action games. While the platforming and targeting system may have some minor flaws, Hi-Fi Rush remains a memorable journey that confidently marches to its own beat. It undoubtedly ranks among the greats in the action genre.</p>
    <h3>5.) Have a Nice Death</h3>
		<img src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/product_box_art/public/2021/12/10/ef06f160/have_a_nice_death_cover_art.jpg" alt="Have a Nice Death">
		<p>This punishing but satisfying roguelike offers challenging boss fights and a darkly dorky setting with office humor that adds charm to its world. However, it becomes more frustrating due to limited defensive abilities and stingy long-term progression, especially when compared to its wide range of enjoyable offensive weapons. Despite the occasional discouragement, the game provides hundreds of visually and mechanically memorable ways to defeat its undead enemies. It's a game of highs and lows, with moments of both frustration and exhilaration.</p>
